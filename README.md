# Neural-Network-in-CPP
This is a C++ implement of simple neural network. It's based on video on "Neural Net in C++" Tutorial by David Miller.

To run the files in command line in windows:

step 1:
g++ ./makeTrainingSamples.cpp -o makeTrainingSamples

step 2:
makeTrainingSamples >out.txt

step 3:
g++ ./neural-net.cpp -o neural-net

step 4:
neural-net

You have successfully trained your neural network to recognize XOR output.
